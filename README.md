Project completion risk simulation

This code can be used to simulate project completion failure risk.
The first section uses deSolve as an exemplar and provides a chart, though it can be extended.
The second section provides the bootsrapping and stores the number of project tasks not completed
and estimates the proportion of failures that are probable.
